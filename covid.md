# Web Scraper

## **Plan**

Navigation:
- Select browser (Webdriver)
- open web page
- locate element
- Click button (if need to)

Manipulation:
- Scrape Data
- Convert data into desired form, like csv, txt, etc.
- Store the data in raw_data folder

## Navigation

### Tools

Selenium
- find_element (XPATH)
- click() (if needed)

### Looking for Dates
- Store dates in list
- Loop thru the dates, locating the the csv files
- 
--> Last was figuring out a function to decide which folder to look for datess,
    or we could just have it loop thru both arbitrarily
